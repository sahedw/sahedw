# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is **Sahed Wahedi**, I'm living in Hamburg and currently on my journey to learn _front end_ technologies.
I love tech and I'm really interested in coding, trying new things and creating stunning and responsive websites. 

Maybe I'm not able to do so right now with my current skillset but sky is the limit as they say!

Also really interested in philosophy, cultures, languages, animes and gaming.

Also attending a coding bootcamp at neue fische right now:
